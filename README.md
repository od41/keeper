# Keeper (WIP)

## Overview

Keeper is a stability pool built for the Canto blockchain. In addition to providing capital efficient access to the stablecoins, it also acts as protection for your perpetual positions on Cadence.

## Features

- Stable coin liquidity
- Yield when you deposit NOTE

## Installation

To install Keeper, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/od41/keeper.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd keeper`
3. Install dependencies: `foundry init`
4. Start the application: `foundry test`

## Usage

1. Connect your wallet to the [frontend](https://keeper-ui.vercel.app).
2. Earn yield when you deposit either CANTO or NOTE to receive kUSD.
3. Protect your perpetual positions on Cadence when you purchase a Keeper protect to prevent capital loss in margin calls.
